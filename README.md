# Bungie Client
This app is my attempt to use the bungie api and display something meaningful to the user, mostly to learn something about frontend along the way. ðŸ™‚

## Dev
After cloninng the repo, the app requires you to have a local `dev.config.js` file. This should look something like the below example and live within the `src` folder.
```
export const config = {
    apiKey: "my-api-key"
}
